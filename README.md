- 👋 Hi, I’m @antoinewojcik
- 👀 I’m interested in video games, languages and I love exploring different things and skills in my life. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning webdev, design and swift/swiftUI. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything, really, I'm happy to learn and help, though my skillset is very limited programming-wise (for now!)
